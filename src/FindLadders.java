/**
 * Given two words (beginWord and endWord),
 * and a dictionary's word list,
 * find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:

 * Only one letter can be changed at a time
 * Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
 * For example,

 * Given:
 * beginWord = "hit"
 * endWord = "cog"
 * wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Return
 * [
 * ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
 * ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
 * ]
 * Note:
 * All words have the same length.
 * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
